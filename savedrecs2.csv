This study aims to investigate high-power sonication to improve polyphenolic content in cold-hardy grape juice in comparison with chokeberry juice. Three solid to solvent ratios and times were applied on chokeberry and 'Marquette' grape berries using 50% ethanol or 13% acidified ethanol and compared to a conventional extraction technique. Iron-reactive phenolic compounds, tannins content, and color were analyzed during the extractions using UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and anthocyanin content was analyzed using HPLC-DAD. At the 1:2 solid to solvent ratio, the color intensity, phenolics, and tannins content were improved using the ultrasound-assisted extraction on chokeberries. However, the tannin content of 'Marquette' berries remained the same with both techniques and solvents, suggesting that the plant cell wall structure may have a strong impact on the retention of tannins from cold-hardy grapes.","[Watrelot, Aude A.; Bouska, Lindsey] Iowa State Univ, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, 536 Farm House Lane, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Watrelot, AA (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, 536 Farm House Lane, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",watrelot@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 30,2022,386,,,,,,,,132703,10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.132703,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.132703,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Zhang, ZR; Wang, LZ",,,,"Zhang, Zerui; Wang, Lizhi",,,A look-ahead approach to maximizing present value of genetic gains in genomic selection,G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Look-ahead selection is a sophisticated yet effective algorithm for genomic selection, which optimizes not only the selection of breeding parents but also mating strategy and resource allocation by anticipating the implications of crosses in a prespecified future target generation. Simulation results using maize datasets have suggested that look-ahead selection is able to significantly accelerate genetic gain in the target generation while maintaining genetic diversity. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to address the limitations of look-ahead selection, including the difficulty in specifying a meaningful deadline in a continuous breeding process and slow growth of genetic gain in early generations. This new algorithm uses the present value of genetic gains as the breeding objective, converting genetic gains realized in different generations to the current generation using a discount rate, similar to using the interest rate to measure the time value of cash flows incurred at different time points. By using the look-ahead techniques to anticipate the future gametes and thus present value of future genetic gains, this algorithm yields a better trade-off between short-term and long-term benefits. Results from simulation experiments showed that the new algorithm can achieve higher genetic gains in early generations and a continuously growing trajectory as opposed to the look-ahead selection algorithm, which features a slow progress in early generations and a growth spike right before the deadline.","[Zhang, Zerui; Wang, Lizhi] Iowa State Univ, Program Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zhang, Zerui] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Wang, Lizhi] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Wang, LZ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",lzwang@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 29,2022,12,8,,,,,,,,10.1093/g3journal/jkac136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkac136,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, such information is often unavailable, incomplete or outdated. The increasing deployment of smart meters (SMs) provides a unique opportunity to tackle this issue. This paper proposes a two-stage framework for distribution grid modeling using SM data. In the first stage, the network topology is identified by reconstructing a weighted Laplacian matrix of distribution networks. In the second stage, a least absolute deviations (LAD) regression model is developed for estimating line impedance of a single branch based on the nonlinear (inverse) power flow model, wherein a conductor library is leveraged to narrow down the solution space. The LAD regression model is originally a mixed-integer nonlinear program whose continuous relaxation is still non-convex. Thus, we specially address its convex relaxation and discuss the exactness. The modified regression model is then embedded within a bottom-up sweep algorithm to achieve the identification across the network in a branch-wise manner. Numerical results on the IEEE 13-bus, 37-bus and 69-bus test feeders validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","[Guo, Yifei; Yuan, Yuxuan; Wang, Zhaoyu] Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Wang, ZY (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",yfguo.sdu@gmail.com; yuanyx@iastate.edu; wzy@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,37,3,,,,,1995,2004,,10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3118004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3118004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Nagawkar, J; Leifsson, L",,,,"Nagawkar, Jethro; Leifsson, Leifur",,,Multifidelity aerodynamic flow field prediction using random forest-based machine learning,AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"In this paper, a novel random forest (RF)-based multifidelity machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict the high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow field is proposed. The RF ML algorithm is used to increase the fidelity of a low-fidelity potential flow field. Three cases are studied, the first two consist of a flow past a backward-facing step, and the third, a subsonic flow around an airfoil. In the first case, the data is generated using ten different inlet velocities, in the second using six different step heights, and in the third using 20 different airfoil shapes parameterized using B-spline curves. Input parameters to RF are case dependent. For the first case, the x and y cell-center locations and the corresponding x and y potential flow velocities, along with the specified inlet velocity, are used. For the second, the cell-center values are nondimensionalized using the step height, and the step height is used in place of the inlet velocity. The remaining two input features used are the same as in the previous case. For the third case, the potential flow stream function and velocity potential along with the B-spline control point values are used as input variables. The outputs of the RF algorithm are the same for all the cases and include the RANS velocities, pressures, and turbulent viscosities. The results in this study are compared to those generated using the tensorFlowFoam (TFF) and from directly solving the RANS equations. To quantify the errors, the absolute error and relative L-2 norm error metrics are used. The results show that for the first two cases, RF consistently has two to 30 times lower relative L-2 norm compared to TFF, with the only exception being the turbulent viscosities for the second case. For the third case, RF is better at predicting the pressure and skin friction coefficients for the RAE 2822 airfoil compared to the NACA 0012 airfoil. The relative L-2 norm error is 1.67 and 1.19 times lower for the pressure and skin friction coefficients, respectively.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, it remains unknown if other impairments, such as swallowing impairment (i.e., dysphagia), also present asymmetrically. Purpose The primary aim of this study was to examine muscle activity associated with swallow on the most affected side (MAS) and least affected side (LAS) in persons with PD. A secondary aim was to explore the relationship between differences in muscle activity associated with swallow and subjective reports of swallowing impairment and disease severity. Methods Function of muscles associated with swallowing was assessed using surface electromyography placed over the right and left submental and laryngeal regions during three swallows for a THIN and THICK condition. The Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were collected as measures of subjective swallow impairment and disease severity, respectively. Results Thirty-five participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD and on a stable antiparkinsonian medication regimen completed this study. Results revealed no significant mean difference in muscle activity during swallow between the more and less affected side. For the laryngeal muscle region, a significant difference in coefficient of variation between the MAS and LAS was revealed for peak amplitude for the THIN swallow condition. For the laryngeal muscle region, a significant association was revealed between muscle activity and disease severity but not subjective reports of swallowing impairment. Conclusion Superficially it appears that swallowing impairment present symmetrical during the early stages of PD, however, our variability data indicates otherwise. These results will be used to inform future studies in specific types of swallowing impairment (i.e., oral dysphagia, pharyngeal dysphagia, and esophageal dysphagia), disease progression, and overall asymmetry.","[Diaz, Kasandra; Stegemoeller, Elizabeth E.

Rover-mounted microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging techniques provide potential and viable methods for the localization of water ice. To this end, the microwave complex dielectric properties of the regolith must be known. Given the scarcity of actual Martian and Lunar regolith samples, regolith simulants provide a close physical representation that can be used for evaluation. These simulants enable the development and testing of systems (e.g., microwave imaging systems) more akin to their final operating environments. The complex dielectric properties of Martian and Lunar regolith simulants were measured at S-band (2.60-3.95 GHz), X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz), and Ku-band (12.4-18.0 GHz) using the well-known completely-filled waveguide method.

Severe hypercalcemia was present on the day of the presentation. Hypercalcemia treatments such as saline diuresis, furosemide (Salix (R), furosemide, Merck Animal Health, Kenilworth, NJ), and dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dexamethasone SP, Mylan, Canonsburg, PA) were initiated. The dog was also administered a single dose of pamidronate disodium (Pamidronate disodium, Mylan, Canonsburg, PA) on the day of presentation. Initially, the patient's clinical signs improved, and the hypercalcemia resolved. Exactly 130 h post-pamidronate disodium (Dexamethasone SP, Mylan, Canonsburg, PA) administration, the patient developed biochemical abnormalities and severe edema, consistent with nephrotic syndrome, and was euthanized. Necropsy results revealed evidence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Unique information: Pamidronate disodium, commonly used for the treatment of hypercalcemia, may have resulted in glomerulosclerosis and nephrotic syndrome in a dog with calcitriol toxicity.

In the USA, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) are currently the top two primary viruses causing swine respiratory diseases. The commonly used PCR-based virus detection methods require virus extraction, nucleic acid purification, and detection, which are relatively time-consuming and expensive. This work reports an integrated magneto-opto-fluidic (iMOF) platform, in which antibody functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can enable efficient enrichment of multiple swine respiratory viruses and a photonic crystal (PC) biosensor can transduce the amount of captured MNP-virus nanoparticles to the change of their reflection signatures. Owing to the high refractive index of Fe2O3 MNPs, the use of MNPs can significantly enhance the PC sensor output. The proof-of-concept validation involves using antibody-functionalized MNPs to recognize IAV and PRRSV and transferring the formed MNP-virus conjugates onto the surface of the PC biosensors to quantify these viruses. The iMOF platform offers a high sensitivity of 3.5 TCID50 mL(-1) and 5.9 TCID50 mL(-1) for detecting IAV and PRRSV, respectively, and a rapid turnaround within one hour, including the MNP-virus conjugation, enrichment, and detection.

We propose a modular approach to deal with the combined navigation and object interaction problem without the need for strictly aligned vision and language training data (e.g., in the form of expert demonstrated trajectories). Such an approach is a significant departure from the traditional end-to-end techniques in this space and allows for a more tractable training process with separate vision and language data sets.

However, many biological processes such as Agrobacterium-host recognition and interaction are still elusive. To accelerate the understanding of this important plant pathogen and further improve its capacity in plant genetic engineering, we adopted a CRISPR RNA-guided integrase system for Agrobacterium genome engineering. In this work, we demonstrate that INsertion of Transposable Elements by Guide RNA-Assisted TargEting (INTEGRATE) can efficiently generate DNA insertions to enable targeted gene knockouts.

While classroom learning is important for acquiring skills and knowledge, it is necessary that learners themselves make use of other resources to supplement their classroom learning. This study explores the use of Online Accessible Resources (OAR) by intermediate-level language learners to find out how they search for and use available online resources and what their perceptions are of the resources they find to supplement their learning. Fourteen college students participated in this study. Data were collected through 74 forms that students filled out, one for each resource they used, and through interviews asking them to reflect upon their completion of the task of locating and using the resources. Findings showed that students were able to take advantage of OAR to practice skills, increase knowledge, and improve learning strategies, but they needed more authentic, daily life video clips that utilize grammar and vocabulary at their proficiency level. The results shed light on what resources are available and what resources are urgently needed for Open Educational Resource creators to design and develop, and how teachers can help learners use the available resources effectively.","[Zhang Shenglan] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Zhang, SL (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",shenglan@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,13,1,,,,,26,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current methods of detecting resistance are limited in turn-around time or universal detection. In this work, a new antimicrobial susceptibility test is developed and validated, which utilizes deuterium labeling of membrane lipids to track the growth of bacterial cells. We hypothesize that deuterium uptake and subsequent labeling of lipids can be detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Additionally, bacteria growth is performed on the MALDI target, minimizing sample preparation materials and time. When two Escherichia coli strains are grown in the presence of deuterium oxide, labeling can be detected in as little as 30 min to 2 h. The labeling efficiency, or the ratio of labeled to unlabeled lipid peaks, provides information about the growth rate of bacteria. This growth ratio can differentiate between resistant and susceptible strains of bacteria as a resistant strain will maintain similar to 50% labeling efficiency between untreated and treated cultures. In comparison, a susceptible strain will see a decrease in fractional abundance of deuterium from similar to 50% in the untreated to similar to 10% in the treated. This approach is applied to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the resistant and susceptible strains from on-target microdroplet culture in a range of antibiotic concentrations. The first antibiotic concentration with a significant decrease in fractional abundance of deuterium correlates well with a traditionally obtained MIC using broth dilution, indicating the clinical relevance of the results.","[Larson, Evan A.; Rensner, Josiah J.; Lee, Young Jin] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Larsen, Kristina R.; Bellaire, Bryan] Iowa State Univ, Dept Vet Microbiol & Prevent Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Lee, YJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",yjlee@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1021/jasms.2c00056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jasms.2c00056,,MAY 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the crucial importance of these domains, the structural and functional basis of transactivation remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)/cAMP response element-binding protein-2, an essential transcription factor for cellular stress adaptation. Bioinformatic sequence analysis of the ATF4 transactivation domain sequence revealed that the first 125 amino acids have noticeably less propensity for structural disorder than the rest of the domain. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy complemented by a range of biophysical methods, we found that the isolated transactivation domain is predominantly yet not fully disordered in solution. We also observed that a short motif at the N-terminus of the transactivation domain has a high helical propensity. Importantly, we found that the N -terminal region of the transactivation domain is involved in transient long-range interactions with the basic-leucine zipper domain involved in DNA binding. Finally, in vitro phosphorylation assays with the casein kinase 2 show that the presence of the basic-leucine zipper domain is required for phosphorylation of the transactivation domain. This study uncovers the intricate coupling existing between the transactivation and basic-leucine zipper domains of ATF4, highlighting its potential regulatory significance.","[Siang, Steven; Underbakke, Eric S.; Roche, Julien] Iowa State Univ, Roy J Carver Dept Biochem Biophys & Mol Biol, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University,"Roche, J (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Roy J Carver Dept Biochem Biophys & Mol Biol, Ames, IA USA.",jroche@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,298,3,,,,,,,101633,10.1016/j.jbc.2022.101633,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.101633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our results are based on wall-resolved large-eddy simulations of pitching aerofoils, with fine spatial and temporal resolution around stall onset. We observe that vertical bar BEF vertical bar reaches a maximum within the stall onset regime identified. By decomposing the contribution to BEF from the flow field, we find that the dominant contribution arises from the laminar leading edge region, due to the combined effect of large clockwise vorticity and favourable pressure gradient. A relatively small contribution originates from the transitional/turbulent laminar separation bubble (LSB) region, due to LSB-induced counter-clockwise vorticity and adverse pre0ssure gradient. This results in BEF being nearly independent of the integration length as long as the region very close to the leading edge is included. This characteristic of BEF yields a major advantage in that the effect of partial or complete inclusion of the noisy LSB region can be filtered out, without changing the BEF peak location in time significantly. Next, we analytically relate BEF to the net wall shear and show that its critical value (= max(vertical bar BEF vertical bar)) corresponds to the instant of maximum net shear prevailing at the wall. Finally, we have also compared BEF with the leading edge suction parameter (LESP) (Ramesh et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 751, 2014, pp. 500-538) and find that the former reaches its maximum value between 0.3. and 0.8. of rotation earlier.","[Sudharsan, Sarasija; Sharma, A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Aerosp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Ganapathysubramanian, B.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Sharma, A (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Aerosp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",sharma@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 25,2022,935,,,,,,,,A10,10.1017/jfm.2021.1149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2021.1149,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specific binding of the receptor molecules with their analyte leads to changes in charge distribution on the nanochannel surfaces modifying the ionic transport across them. The magnitude of impedance change due to receptor/ligand binding or sensor sensitivity depends on a large number of parameters and consequently, identification of parameters that result in sensitive and specific sensing performance is extremely tedious and cost-intensive. We rely on a 'virtual EIS' procedure that models the transient ionic current due to a step-change in voltage to determine the frequency-dependent impedance of an asymmetrically functionalized nanochannel. This procedure is used to predict the impedance changes due to the specific binding of thrombin on nanochannel surfaces. Surface charge changes associated with the binding of thrombin protein on the aptamer coated surface result in a decrease of the membrane impedance and computational results suggest that a reduction in the ionic strength of the electrolyte leads to an increase in the magnitude of binding induced impedance reduction. Sensing experiments with thrombin binding aptamer are performed to evaluate the trends from the high-throughput computations. The agreement between model predictions and experimental observations suggests that the present modeling approach may be utilized to computationally evaluate sensor performance for a range of parameters and rapidly identify sensor configurations that enable point-of-care diagnostic devices with improved sensitivities.

In addition to the ambient ozonolysis of fingerprint lipids previously reported, we observed unique spectral features associated with epoxides and medium chain fatty acid degradation products that are correlated with fingerprint age. We propose an ambient epoxidation mechanism via a peroxyl radical intermediate and the prevalence of omega-10 fatty acyl chains in fingerprint lipids to explain the features observed by the KMD plot analysis. Our hypotheses are supported by an aging experiment performed in a sparse ozone condition and on-surface Paterno`-Buchi reaction.

Oral ALT supplementation during HS reduced the transcript abundance of HSP90 alpha family class B member 1 (HSP90AB1, P = 0.04); but HS increased HSP90AB1 (P = 0.001), HSPA1A (P = 0.02), and HSPA6 (P = 0.04) transcript abundance irrespective of ALT. ALT supplementation decreased HSP90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1, P = 0.001) protein abundance, irrespective of thermal environment, whereas ALT only decreased HSPA6 (P = 0.02) protein abundance in TN gilts. These results indicate a notable shift of HSP in the porcine endometrium during the peri-implantation period in response to pregnancy status and heat stress.","[Adur, Malavika K.; Seibert, Jacob T.; Romoser, Matthew R.; Bidne, Katie L.; Baumgard, Lance H.; Keating, Aileen F.; Ross, Jason W.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Ross, JW (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jwross@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1,2022,100,7,,,,,,,skac129,10.1093/jas/skac129,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/skac129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In pigs, this infecundity is referred to as seasonal infertility (SI), a phenotype including ovarian dysfunction. In multiple species, HS-induced hyperprolactinemia has been described; hence, our study objectives were to characterize and compare HS effects on circulating prolactin (PRL) and ovarian Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling during the follicular (FOL) or luteal (LUT) phases of the estrous cycle in postpubertal gilts. Gilts were estrus synchronized using altrenogest and environmental treatments began immediately after altrenogest withdrawal. For the FOL study: postpubertal gilts were allocated to constant thermoneutral (TN; n = 6; 20 +/- 1.2 degrees C) or cyclical HS (n = 6; 25 to 32 +/- 1.2 degrees C) conditions for 5 d. In the LUT study: postpubertal gilts were assigned to either TN (n = 7; 20 +/- 2.6 degrees C) or cyclical HS (n = 7; 32 to 35 +/- 2.6 degrees C) conditions from 2 to 12 days postestrus (dpe). Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture for PRL quantification on day 5 in the FOL and on day 0 and day 12 in the LUT gilts. Ovaries and corpora lutea (CL) were obtained from euthanized FOL and LUT gilts on day 5 and day 12, respectively. Western blotting was performed to quantify prolactin receptor (PRLR) and JAK/STAT pathway protein abundance. In the FOL phase, no difference (P = 0.20) in circulating PRL between thermal groups was observed. There was no effect (P >= 0.34) of HS on PRLR, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 alpha (STAT5 alpha), and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription alpha/beta tyrosine 694/699 (pSTAT5 alpha/beta(Tyr694/699)) abundance and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phosphorylated janus kinase 2 tyrosine 1007/1008 (pJAK2(Tyr1007/1008)), STAT1, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 tyrosine 701 (pSTAT1(Tyr701)), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 serine 727 (pSTAT1(Ser727)), and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 tyrosine 705 (pSTAT3(Tyr705)) were undetectable in FOL gilt ovaries. Ovarian pSTAT5 alpha/beta(Tyr694/699) abundance tended to moderately increase (4%; P = 0.07) in FOL gilts by HS. In the LUT phase, circulating PRL increased progressively from 2 to 12 dpe, but no thermal treatment-induced difference (P = 0.37) was noted. There was no effect (P >= 0.16) of HS on CL abundance of PRLR, pJAK2(Tyr1007/1008), JAK2, STAT1, pSTAT1(Tyr701), pSTAT1(Ser727), pSTAT3(Tyr705), STAT5 alpha, or pSTAT5 alpha/beta(Tyr694/699). In LUT phase, CL STAT3 abundance was increased (11%; P < 0.03) by HS. There was no impact of HS (P >= 0.76) on levels of pJAK2(Tyr1007/1008) and pSTAT5 alpha/beta(Tyr694/699) in LUT gilts; however, the CL pSTAT3(Tyr705):STAT3 ratio tended to be decreased (P = 0.10) due to HS. These results indicate an HS-induced estrous cycle-stage-dependent effect on the ovarian JAK/STAT pathway, establishing a potential role for this signaling pathway as a potential contributor to SI. Heat stress causes hyperprolactinemia in several species. This study examined a role for prolactin-mediated ovarian and luteal JAK-STAT alterations during heat stress in the pig. Lay Summary Heat stress (HS) negatively affects reproduction in pigs, though the precise mechanisms are not understood. This study determined if HS impacts the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the ovary during two stages of the estrous cycle: follicular and luteal. While circulating prolactin hormone level was unchanged, there were changes to some aspects of ovarian JAK-STAT signaling that could be involved in infertility induced in pigs during HS.","[Roach, Crystal M.; Bidne, Katie L.; Romoser, Matthew R.; Ross, Jason W.; Baumgard, Lance H.; Keating, Aileen F.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Keating, AF (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",akeating@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1,2022,100,7,,,,,,,skac118,10.1093/jas/skac118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/skac118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We combine principles from emerging climate storylines research with collaborative storytelling inspired by William Shakespeare's plays and theatrical practices. Shakespeare's plays spark collaborations and interpretations, in part, because of how Shakespeare leaves gaps in the narrative. These gaps allow others to enter as collaborators, creating a cognitive ecology that fosters knowledge and action among all engaged. Integrating these methods into climate storyline-making offers a radical paradigm: it upends the scientist's role as the focal storyteller and expert, and fosters, instead, partnership, equity, and a co-exploration of multiple uncertainties.

A 12-year-old neutered female Pembroke Welsh Corgi weighing 20 kg was evaluated after ingesting 223 mg/kg of carprofen. Emesis was attempted with apomorphine at the primary care veterinarian but was unsuccessful, and a dose of activated charcoal with sorbitol was administered. On presentation to the referral center, approximately 8 hours after ingestion, the dog's physical examination revealed mild abdominal discomfort but was otherwise unremarkable. Treatment consisted of a combination of supportive care including activated charcoal with sorbitol, cholestyramine, IV lipid emulsion, and manual TPE. Blood samples were collected prior to the initiation of manual TPE and at the completion of 12 exchange cycles. Carprofen levels were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A 57% decrease in carprofen levels was achieved with the combination of activated charcoal, cholestyramine, IV lipid emulsion, and manual TPE. The dog did not develop organ dysfunction secondary to toxicity and was discharged 4 days after ingestion.

One key research need is to explore low-cost active electrocatalysts. Here, we report a facile, solvent-free method to synthesize a metal-free nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N-OMC) by in situ transforming of glycine (carbon and nitrogen precursors) in the mesoporous SiO2 template (KIT-6) followed by subsequent thermal treatment at different temperatures. Among all samples, the catalyst treated at 800 degrees C ( N-OMC-800), the nitrogen-rich carbon, exhibits outstanding structural properties and porosity, showing the dominant formation of pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N. With combined improved structural properties with the optimal ratio of N-pyrrolic/N-graphitic, P/G carbon provided an outstanding electrocatalytic activity, promoting H2O2 with high selectivity and production rate in alkaline mediums. The N-OMC-800 can achieve a faradaic efficiency (FE) of similar to 100% to H2O2 at (0.6 V-RHE to 0.4 V-RHE) in a H-cell containing 0.1 M KOH. Furthermore, its bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis in our self-designed flow cell confirmed its practical capability by showing a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 9.43 mol gcat(-1) h(-1) at 0.35 V-RHE and maintaining nearly 100% FE at the cathode potential of 0.6 V-RHE for 12 h without any degradation.","[Rawah, Basil Sabri; Albloushi, Mohammad; Li, Wenzhen] Iowa State Univ, Biorenewables Res Lab, Chem & Biol Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Li, WZ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Biorenewables Res Lab, Chem & Biol Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",wzli@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2,2022,10,17,,,,,5453,5462,,10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c08285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c08285,,APR 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The low viscosity and high hydrophobicity of the CPIL precursor allow it to be patterned by established microfluidic methods. This advancement has the potential to impact microscale analysis because it allows on-demand creation of solid CPIL microstructures at locations specified by microfluidics, phase boundaries, and electrode potentials. To achieve this outcome, an imidazolium-based IL was functionalized with a pyrrole moiety, and the viscosity was tuned by choosing the appropriate counterion to form a CPIL with the desired viscosity, hydrophobicity, and oxidation potential. This monomer species was then introduced into a microfluidic device, which was prefilled with an aqueous buffer solution. The device comprised many parallel microchannels lined with nanoliter-scale chambers. BPEs interconnected the channels such that the BPE tips were each aligned to a chamber opening. The electrodes contacting the outermost channels were connected directly to a power supply and functioned as driving electrodes. The CPIL displaced the buffer in the channels and established a phase boundary at the opening of each chamber, thereby digitizing the aqueous phase. Finally, an alternating square waveform (under mode 1) was applied for 5 min to yield immobilized polymer films at a location defined by the BPE poles. In total, three modes were developed and three corresponding polymer film patterns were formed. Under mode 2, a DC power supply was used to achieve a dissymmetrical polymer film pattern, and, under mode 3, a regional polymer film pattern was formed under an AC potential with a DC offset. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the generated polymer films are immobile and sufficiently thick to seal the chambers at room temperature over the duration of our observation window (50 min), and this seal is maintained even at elevated temperatures that induce partial evaporation of the chamber contents. A key point is that this method is compatible with a preceding step-dielectrophoretic capture of single melanoma cells within the nanoliter-scale chambers.","[Chen, Han; Anderson, Jared L.; Anand, Robbyn K.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Anderson, JL; Anand, RK (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",andersoj@iastate.edu; rkanand@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR 13,2022,14,16,,,,,18087,18096,,10.1021/acsami.1c25230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c25230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Burton, P",,,,"Burton, Peter",,,Statistical constructions in quantum information theory,QUANTUM STUDIES-MATHEMATICS AND FOUNDATIONS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"We introduce a notion of strategies based on averaging for nonlocal games in quantum information theory. These so-called statistical strategies come in a commuting type and a more specific spatial type, which are, respectively, special cases of the quantum commuting and quantum spatial strategies commonly considered in the field. We prove a theorem that the sets of statistical commuting strategies and statistical spatial strategies are, respectively, equal to the sets of quantum commuting strategies and quantum spatial strategies for any nonlocal game. Thus we are able to use the recent negative solution of Tsirelson's problem in [14] to obtain a statistical analog showing that there exists a nonlocal game where the set of statistical commuting strategies properly contains the closure of the set of statistical spatial strategies. The proof of this theorem involves development of statistical replicas for numerous constructions in quantum information theory, in particular for the Fourier-type duality between observation structures and dynamical structures. The main point of the argument is to apply the established theory of approximating unitary representations of countable discrete groups by ergodic measure preserving actions of such groups. We note that the relevant groups are nonamenable. We also give an explicit description of a statistical strategy to win the CHSH game from Aspect's experiment with a probability exceeding the maximum possible value for a classical strategy.","[Burton, Peter] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Burton, P (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",burtonpeterj@icloud.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,9,3,,,,,265,285,,10.1007/s40509-022-00269-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40509-022-00269-x,,MAR 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper considers how to modify acyclic phylogenetic networks into other acyclic networks by contracting specific arcs that include a set D. The networks need not be binary, so vertices in the networks may have more than two parents and/or more than two children. In general, in order to make the resulting network acyclic, additional arcs not in D must also be contracted. This paper shows how to choose D so that the resulting acyclic network is pre-normal. As a result, removal of all redundant arcs yields a normal network. The set D can be selected based only on the geometry of the network, giving a well-defined normal phylogenetic network depending only on the given network. There are CSD maps relating most of the networks. The resulting network can be visualized as a wired lift in the original network, which appears as the original network with each arc drawn in one of three ways.","[Willson, Stephen J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Math, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Willson, SJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Math, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",swillson@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,84,2,,,,,,,26,10.1007/s11538-021-00986-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00986-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using Federal Communication Commission (FCC)-derived data from more than 3,700 political advertising contracts, and responses to two waves of surveys among Iowa voters, this research considers the connection between advertising weight (adspend) and political outcomes in a media-saturated campaign. In contrast to some earlier studies, increasing levels of advertising spending did not serve to activate the interest of potential voters: while it was high to begin with, and went higher during the election period, the extra advertising was not associated with additional interest. However, increased advertising did result shifting of allegiances in the crowded Republican Caucus: in markets with heavy advertising, there was more churn in candidate preference. Additionally, overall adspend was correlated modestly with political outcomes: for the most part, high-spending candidates were the most successful in gaining support at the Caucuses.","[Newell, Jay] Iowa State Univ, Greenlee Sch Journalism & Commun, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Newell, J (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Greenlee Sch Journalism & Commun, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",newelljj@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2,2022,21,1,,,,,1,22,,10.1080/15377857.2018.1513384,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15377857.2018.1513384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study looks at how disciplinary identity is constructed in this register through the use of the subjective first-person pronoun I from a Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) perspective. This is done through the analysis of: (1) the variation of I in evaluative journal articles across six dis-ciplines (i.e., Applied Linguistics, Biology, History, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science) and (2) the process types (e.g., material, mental) that authors use with I to construct a particular disciplinary identity. Findings show that social science and humanities authors use I much more frequently than hard science authors, but also that the frequency of I in the hard sciences is not negligible when compared to previous research. Another impor-tant finding is that disciplinary differences are reflected in both the frequency and use of process types. The findings are highly relevant for teaching graduate students discipline-appropriate ways of identity construction in evaluative registers, such as critiques. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel virus, provisionally named Walnut Creek virus, was isolated from Cx. tarsalis, and its genomic sequence and organization are characteristic of viruses in the genus Hapavirus (family Rhabdoviridae). Replication of Walnut Creek virus occurred in avian, mammalian, and mosquito, but not tick, cell lines. A novel virus was also isolated from Cx. restuans, and partial genome sequencing revealed that it is distantly related to an unclassified virus of the genus Phytoreovirus (family Sedoreoviridae). Two recognized viruses were also isolated: Culex Y virus (family Birnaviridae) and Houston virus (family Mesoniviridae). We also identified sequences of eight novel viruses from six families (Amalgaviridae, Birnaviridae, Partitiviridae, Sedoreoviridae, Tombusviridae, and Totiviridae), two viruses that do not belong to any established families, and many previously recognized viruses.

The Plasmodium NPC is poorly defined due to its evolutionary divergent nature making it impossible to characterize it via homology searches. Twenty years since the publication of the Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei genomes one-third of their protein-coding genes still lack functional annotation. In the absence of sequence and structural homology, protein-protein interactions can facilitate functional prediction of such orphan genes by mapping protein complexes in their natural cellular environment. The Plasmodium nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a case in point: it remains poorly defined; its constituents lack conservation with the 30+ proteins described in the NPC of many opisthokonts, a clade of eukaryotes that includes fungi and animals, but not Plasmodium. Here, we developed a labeling methodology based on TurboID fusion proteins, which allows visualization of the P. berghei NPC and facilitates the identification of its components. Following affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified 4 known nucleoporins (Nups) (138, 205, 221, and the bait 313), and verify interaction with the putative phenylalanine-glycine (FG) Nup637; we assigned 5 proteins lacking annotation (and therefore meaningful homology with proteins outside the genus) to the NPC, which is confirmed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging. Based on gene deletion attempts, all new Nups - Nup176, 269, 335, 390, and 434 - are essential to parasite survival. They lack primary sequence homology with proteins outside the Plasmodium genus; albeit 2 incorporate short domains with structural homology to human Nup155 and yeast Nup157, and the condensin SMC (Structural Maintenance Of Chromosomes 4). The protocols developed here showcase the power of proximity labeling for elucidating protein complex composition and annotation of taxonomically restricted genes in Plasmodium. It opens the door to exploring the function of the Plasmodium NPC and understanding its evolutionary position. IMPORTANCE The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a platform for constant evolution and has been used to study the evolutionary patterns of early-branching eukaryotes. The Plasmodium NPC is poorly defined due to its evolutionary divergent nature making it impossible to characterize it via homology searches. Although 2 decades have passed since the publication of the Plasmodium genome, 30% of the genes still lack functional annotation. Our study demonstrates the ability of proximity labeling using TurboID to assign function to orphan proteins in the malaria parasite. We have identified a total of 10 Nups that will allow further study of NPC dynamics, structural elements, involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and unique non-transport functions of nucleoporins that provide adaptability to this malaria parasite.","[Ambekar, Sushma, V; Beck, Josh R.; Mair, Gunnar R.] Iowa State Univ, Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Beck, JR; Mair, GR (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Biomed Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jrbeck@iastate.edu; mair@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1128/mbio.01815-22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01815-22,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Franklin, WL",,,,"Franklin, William L.",,,"Guanaco colonisation of Tierra del Fuego Island from mainland Patagonia: Walked, swam, or by canoe?",GEO-GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Addressed here is the biogeographical-vexing question of why the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is the only large mammal on the big island of Tierra del Fuego, answered by comparing alternative colonisation hypotheses. A multidisciplinary examination was conducted into the archaeological, ecological, evolutionary, geographical, genomic, glacial and zoological past, plus distribution of native terrestrial vertebrates in the Patagonia of southern South America. Notable disparities exist between main Patagonia (2.5 species/10,000 km(2)) compared with Tierra del Fuego (1.8). In the similar-sized area of mainland Patagonia just north of the Strait of Magellan there are 12 reptiles, 7 amphibians and 34 mammals = 53 total species; Tierra del Fuego has 13. Despite being the size of Switzerland and only 3.5 km from the mainland, Tierra del Fuego has no species of snakes, salamanders, frogs or turtles, only one lizard, one toad, nine small mammals, one carnivore and one ungulate, the Guanaco. An innovative proposal is made contrary to traditional thinking: Tierra del Fuego has relatively few native-terrestrial vertebrates because they were decimated by major tephra-ash fallout (2 to >15 cm) from the Holocene 7750 YBP (years before present) Hudson volcano, the biggest and most destructive eruption in Patagonia during the past 10,000 years that eradicated indigenous peoples, most terrestrial vertebrates and all Guanacos. Neither terrestrial vertebrates nor man were replenished from the adjacent mainland for 1000 years because the Strait of Magellan was a complete biogeographical barrier. Guanacos on Tierra del Fuego have lower genetic diversity compared with the mainland, suggesting it is a younger population. Empirical evidence and pivotal events of Patagonia's prehistory support one of three hypotheses: guanacos were introduced to Tierra del Fuego by early Holocene, guanaco-dependent, indigenous peoples from the mainland who repopulated Tierra del Fuego utilising the newly invented, skilfully crafted, seaworthy bark canoe (Appendix S1-Resumen en Espanol).","[Franklin, William L.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 339 Sci Hall 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Franklin, WL (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 339 Sci Hall 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",wlf@myomnitel.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,9,2,,,,,,,e00110,10.1002/geo2.110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/geo2.110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies have indicated a rise in fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQ-R) Campylobacter in cattle, where FQ is used to control bovine respiratory disease (BRD). To assess the effect of danofloxacin treatment on the development of FQ-resistance in C. jejuni, 30 commercial calves were divided into Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 (n = 10), and were all inoculated orally with FQ-susceptible (FQ-S) C. jejuni; seven days later, Group 3 was challenged with transtracheal Mannheimia haemolytica, and one week later, Group 2 and Group 3 were injected subcutaneously with danofloxacin. Rectal feces were collected to determine relative percentages of FQ-R Campylobacter via culture. Before oral inoculation with C. jejuni, 87% of calves were naturally colonized by FQ-R C. jejuni. Two days after the inoculation, FQ-R C. jejuni decreased substantially in the majority of calves. Within 24 h of danofloxacin injection, almost all C. jejuni populations shifted to an FQ-R phenotype in both FQ-treated groups, which was only transitory, as FQ-S strains became predominant during later periods. Genotyping indicated that the spike seen in FQ-R C. jejuni populations following the injection was due mainly to enrichment of preexisting FQ-R C. jejuni, rather than development of de novo FQ resistance in susceptible strains. These results provide important insights into the dynamic changes of FQ-resistant Campylobacter in cattle in response to FQ treatment.","[Goulart, Debora Brito; Beyi, Ashenafi Feyisa; Wu, Zuowei; Adiguzel, Mehmet Cemal; Schroeder, Anastasia; Singh, Kritika; Xu, Changyun; Ocal, Melda Meral; Plummer, Paul J.; Zhang, Qijing] Iowa State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Vet Microbiol & Prevent Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Dewell, Renee] Iowa State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Ctr Food Secur & Publ Hlth, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Dewell, Grant A.; Plummer, Paul J.; Sahin, Orhan] Iowa State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Vet Diagnost & Prod Anim Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Plummer, Paul J.] Iowa State Univ, Natl Inst Antimicrobial Resistance Res & Educ, Ames, IA 50010 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Sahin, O (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Vet Diagnost & Prod Anim Med, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dgoulart@iastate.edu; afbeyi@iastate.edu; wuzw@iastate.edu; mcemaladiguzel@gmail.com; schroana@iastate.edu; kritika.39@gmail.com; xuchangyun1987@gmail.com; meralmelda@hotmail.com; rdewell@iastate.edu; gdewell@iastate.edu; pplummer@iastate.edu; zhang123@iastate.edu; osahin@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,11,4,,,,,,,531,10.3390/antibiotics11040531,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics11040531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many of the manufacturers provide software offerings to help users choose print settings to reduce errors, and the corresponding number of times a part must be printed. However, these offerings often present a myriad of settings to adjust without a clear indication of the outcomes. These settings, combined with environmental effects must be simulated, and pre-sented so a user can understand and avoid common print failures.

Biologists have long sought to characterize the extent of morphological integration in organisms, but comparing levels of integration for a set of traits across taxa has been hampered by the lack of a reliable summary measure and testing procedure. Here, we propose a standardized effect size for this purpose, calculated from the relative eigenvalue variance, Vrel$V_{rel}$. First, we evaluate several eigenvalue dispersion indices under various conditions, and show that only Vrel$V_{rel}$ remains stable across samples size and the number of variables. We then demonstrate that Vrel$V_{rel}$ accurately characterizes input patterns of covariation, so long as redundant dimensions are excluded from the calculations. However, we also show that the variance of the sampling distribution of Vrel$V_{rel}$ depends on input levels of trait covariation, making Vrel$V_{rel}$ unsuitable for direct comparisons. As a solution, we propose transforming Vrel$V_{rel}$ to a standardized effect size (Z-score) for representing the magnitude of integration for a set of traits. We also propose a two-sample test for comparing the strength of integration between taxa, and show that this test displays appropriate statistical properties. We provide software for implementing the procedure, and an empirical example illustrates its use.","[Conaway, Mark A.; Adams, Dean C.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Adams, DC (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dcadams@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/evo.14595,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evo.14595,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We previously recommended that where possible, maintaining 2-4 ramets of closely-spaced common milkweed would support the development of at least one monarch through pupation, based on a seemingly innate behavior in which monarch larvae (Danaus plexippus) abandon their natal milkweed ramet (Asclepias sp.). Here, we explored the impact of intraspecific competition on larval ramet abandonment behavior and fitness of monarch larvae in small artificial milkweed patches. We observed larvae reared under direct and indirect intraspecific competition, and larvae reared alone. We found no influence of intraspecific competition; however, our study provides further support that milkweed ramet abandonment is a seemingly innate behavior. This behavior occurs before all of the available leaf biomass on a ramet is consumed and prior to the pre-pupal wandering stage. Implications for insect conservation: Results from our study suggest that in the absence of predation, parasitism, and interspecific competition, and when sufficient plant biomass is present to support larval development, the presence of an intraspecific competitor does not influence larval behavior or fitness. Based on milkweed ramet abandonment behavior, we continue to suggest maintaining small patches of 2-4 milkweed ramets when possible.","[Fisher, Kelsey E.; Bradbury, Steven P.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Bradbury, Steven P.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Fisher, KE (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",kefisher@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,26,5,,,,,851,856,,10.1007/s10841-022-00408-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00408-0,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The plant is grown in a miniature plant growth chamber (PGC). Root exudates of the plant provide carbon-containing organic matter to support the catalytic reaction of the bacteria inoculated and grown on the carbon cloth anode of a miniature microbial fuel cell (MFC). The mPFMC utilizes a semipermeable hydrophilic filtering membrane to separate the PGC from the MFC. This membrane allows retaining the bacteria inside the MFC for inoculation and growth and prevents them from entering the PGC; however, the membrane still permits the root exudates into the MFC as the sole carbon source to the bacteria grown on the anode of the device. A pilot proof-of-concept study was conducted to validate the mPMFC, by using it to examine electricity generation of the device with different varieties of model organisms, including rice plant cultivars Kitaake and IR24, and bacterial species Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14. The plant cultivars were grown hydroponically without using soils, thus eliminating the effect of soil microorganisms and nutrients on the bioelectricity generation of the device. The present mPFMC has high compactness with the dimensions of 25 x 25 x 29 mm3, consumes only 3 mL volume of plant growth medium and less than 1 mL volume of anolyte and catholyte each, and produces electricity within only several hours after the plants are loaded into the device. The present technology will allow large-scale parallel screening of different combinations of small plants and electrogenic bacteria and their strains for bioelectricity generation.","[Jiang, Huawei; Dong, Liang] Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Halverson, Larry J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Dong, Liang] Iowa State Univ, Microelect Res Ctr, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Dong, L (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Dong, L (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Microelect Res Ctr, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ldong@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1,2022,342,,,,,,,,113649,10.1016/j.sna.2022.113649,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2022.113649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many of these methods require cumbersome training or intrusive authentication. Software keyboard interactions provide a consistent biometric data stream.

However, there are difficulties when it comes to structural monitoring of bridges and other structures. This is especially true for bridge decks with overlays as the deck substrate is not visible and existing inspection methods can be imprecise. Recent developments in nondestructive testing technology have opened the door for innovative inspection methods for infrastructure. One such technology is ultrasound evaluation, specifically in the form of linear arrays. One Ultrasonic Tomography Device (UTD), called MIRA, which implements this technology was deployed on a bridge deck to explore its capabilities with respect to assessing the internal condition of a deck with an existing overlay present. To achieve this objective, a 65-year-old bridge deck was selected for the ultrasound evaluation. Five locations with various overlay and deck conditions were scanned. The results indicated that when the overlay and the concrete deck are in good condition, the UTD could effectively detect the location and size of the top layer rebar and the deck thickness. It was also found that although the UTD scans showed a large area near the bottom of the deck (about 575 mm below the surface), it could not clearly decipher between the bottom surface of the deck and the bottom layer reinforcement. In addition, when visible cracks exist in the overlay, the UTD scans cannot clearly show the rebar details and deck thickness. The results indicate potential for determining the extent of bridge deck deterioration for the purposes of maintenance and rehabilitation planning efforts. Further research is proposed for a laboratory investigation with known internal deck condition to determine the influence from the cracking in the overlay level and damage in the deck on the UTD scan results.","[Sanderson, Tristan] Iowa State Univ, CCEE, Ames, IA 50010 USA; [Sanderson, Tristan; Liu, Zhengyu] Iowa State Univ, Bridge Engn Ctr, 2711 South Loop Dr,Suite 4700, Ames, IA 50010 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Sanderson, T (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Bridge Engn Ctr, 2711 South Loop Dr,Suite 4700, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",tsanders@iastate.edu; kfreese@iastate.edu; zhengyu@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,16,,,,,,,,e00878,10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e00878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2022.e00878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

ACT is a third-wave cognitive-behavioral approach that utilizes experiential methods to foster psychological flexibility. The Duluth Model curriculum is an educational approach grounded in feminist theory that focuses on changing attitudes toward women and unlearning power and control motivations. This trial was preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT03609801). Method: This study included 338 men who were court-mandated to complete a domestic violence program after being convicted of assault against a female partner. Participants were randomized to complete the 24 sessions of the ACT program or the Duluth Model Men's Nonviolence Classes. Outcomes included criminal justice data (domestic violence charges, other violent charges, and nonviolent charges) incurred during the 1 year following program dropout or completion, and victim reports of intimate partner violence (IPV; aggression, controlling behaviors, and stalking/harassment). Results: In intent-to-treat comparisons to Duluth, ACT participants did not show a difference in domestic assault charges at 1 year posttreatment (p = .44). ACT participants acquired significantly fewer violent charges (p = .04) and nonviolent charges (p = .02) compared to Duluth participants. Data from victims indicated that victims of ACT participants reported significantly fewer IPV behaviors than victims of Duluth participants on the Conflict Tactics Scale (d = .78), the Controlling Behaviors Scale (d = .66) and the Stalking Behavior Checklist (d = .71) at 1 year posttreatment. Conclusions: An ACT-based group intervention delivered in community corrections reduced violent and nonviolent criminal charges compared to the Duluth classes. Domestic violence charges did not differ between groups but victim reports indicated that ACT participants engaged in fewer IPV behaviors. What is the public health significance of this article? This study suggests that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an effective treatment for domestic violence among men court-ordered to complete a batterers intervention program.","[Zarling, Amie; Russell, Dan] Iowa State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, 1358 Palmer Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Zarling, A (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, 1358 Palmer Bldg, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",azarling@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,90,4,,,,,326,338,,10.1037/ccp0000722,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within this transition, brittle and viscous phases coexist, forming semi-frictional materials. While semi-frictional deformation on large scales might play an important role in understanding the transition between earthquakes and slow slip/creep, it can also be observed at smaller scales. Here, we use field observations of the Papoose Flat pluton in eastern California to study deformation of heterogeneous materials during shearing. Clast concentration varies between 2% and 12% by area. Field and microscopic observations show that the matrix deforms viscously, while the clasts fail in a brittle manner. We systematically document clast concentration and spacing with respect to clast fracturing and observe increasing frictional failure of clasts with increasing clast concentration. To test which matrix viscosities impose enough stresses on the clasts to lead to frictional deformation, we complement field observations with 2D numerical models. Maps with 7% by area randomly placed circular clasts are created and deformed under simple shear kinematic conditions. We test different matrix viscosities, from constant low and high viscosity (10(17) and 10(19) Pa.s, respectively), to dislocation creep for granite. Clasts in the vicinity of other clasts are affected by stresses around their neighbors. This effect decreases with increasing clast distance. Our field observations and numerical results suggest that the viscous phase can impose significant stresses onto the brittle phase, causing failure even at very low clast concentrations and in the absence of clast-clast interactions.","[Ioannidi, Paraskevi Io; Bogatz, Kyle; Reber, Jacqueline E.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Ioannidi, PI (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ioannidi.iop@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,23,3,,,,,,,e2021GC010127,10.1029/2021GC010127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GC010127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the past decade, loose anchor rod nuts have proven to need frequent attention, incurring significant cost, while endangering the safety of sign-support structures. In particular, connections tightened with the current pre-tensioning specifications are found to have been loosened within only a year (if not sooner) after installation. Considering this long-standing issue, the objective of this study is to investigate the structural behavior of large anchor bolts used at the base of sign-support structures and evaluate the parameters that influence the rod tightening and loosening process most. For this purpose, a set of Skidmore-Wilhelm bolt tension calibrator tests were performed on different sizes of bolt that had been lubricated with various methods. The tests were to evaluate the effects of the lubrication method on the tightening process. In addition, a sign-post structure removed from the field was tested in the laboratory to study the bolt behavior when it was subjected to the lateral load. Finite-element models were then developed and calibrated using the data collected form the laboratory test. A parametric study was conducted on the calibrated model to understand the effects of key contributing factors, such as level of tightening preload, variation of preload level, washer size, and grip length, on the tightening and loosening process. The investigations determined that the current tightening process can generate a stress concentration in the rod in the range of 30 ksi, which was 55% of the rod's yield strength. The clamping force was also noted to experience a significant reduction during the first few cycles of loading (i.e., up to 20 cycles), beyond which further reduction was minimal. The outcome of this study directly helps choose a preload level that ensures adequate tightening, while avoiding permanent damage to the rod. This is critical for preventing or alleviating the issue of nut loosening.","[Liu, Zhengyu; Phares, Brent M.] Iowa State Univ, Bridge Engn Ctr, Ames, IA 50010 USA; [Dietrich, Zachary; Shafei, Behrouz] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, Ames, IA 50010 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Liu, ZY (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Bridge Engn Ctr, Ames, IA 50010 USA.",zhengyu@iastate.edu; ZDietrich@BiggsCardosa.com; bphares@iastate.edu; shafei@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,190,,,,,,,,107144,10.1016/j.jcsr.2022.107144,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcsr.2022.107144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

With 5 mu m beta-Ga2O3 drift layer, the ideal breakdown voltage (BV) of the heterojunction was 1.37 kV, while the BV of the reference device without effective mesa edge termination decreased dramatically to 300 V due to the electric field crowding at the device edge. Four mesa ET structures were investigated to mitigate the electric field crowding at the junction edge, including beveled mesa, step mesa, deeply etched mesa, and p-doped guard ring. Without effective ET, the peak electric field at the junction edge was similar to 4.2 MV/cm at -300 V. By incorporating these ET techniques, the peak electric fields were reduced significantly to 0.73 MV/cm. Ideal BV of 1.37 kV was achievable using deeply etched mesa and guard ring ETs. The beveled mesa realized >80% of the ideal BV, while step mesa ET was less effective in alleviating the electric field crowding and only offered similar to 40% of the ideal BV.

A theory-grounded, normalized measure of systemic risk, R-2, is developed and made amenable to empirical analysis through the logit link. The measure is estimated on a large-scale, unit-level corn yield dataset. We find that systemic risk explains less than half of total unit yield variability on average, suggesting that the risk management effectiveness of area yield insurance is low. By relating natural resource endowments with systemic risk, we find that more excessive heat and drought events lead to larger while more excessive precipitation events lead to smaller systemic risk. We then study whether current area yield insurance subsidy rates provide farmers with sufficient subsidy transfers to compensate for the uncovered risk exposure associated with area yield insurance. A new concept, the threshold relative area subsidy rate (TRASR), quantifies a lower bound on the ratio of area yield insurance subsidy rate over individual yield insurance subsidy rate below which risk-averse farmers should always prefer individual yield insurance to area yield insurance. The calibrated TRASR values indicate that current area yield insurance subsidy rates discourage farmers from choosing area yield insurance over individual yield insurance, especially at low area yield insurance coverage levels. We also find that TRASR is positively correlated with systemic risk at the unit-level of analysis, suggesting that farmers who like area yield insurance's risk management features will dislike its transfer implications and vice versa.","[Gong, Xuche; Hennessy, David A.; Feng, Hongli] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Gong, XC (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",xcgong@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/ajae.12342,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12342,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given that both HS and ZEN independently cause oxidative stress, we hypothesized that simultaneous exposure to HS and ZEN would cause greater oxidative stress in porcine skeletal muscle than either condition, alone. To address this hypothesis, crossbred, prepubertal gilts were treated with either vehicle control (cookie dough) or ZEN (40 mu g/kg) and exposed to either thermoneutral (TN; 21.0 degrees C) or 12-h diurnal HS conditions (night: 32.2 degrees C; day: 35.0 degrees C) for 7 d. Pigs were euthanized immediately following the environmental challenge and the glycolytic (STW) and oxidative (STR) portions of the semitendinosus muscle were collected for analysis. In STR, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, a marker of oxidative stress, tended to increase following ZEN exposure (P = 0.08). HS increased CAT (P = 0.019) and SOD1 (P = 0.049) protein abundance, while ZEN decreased GPX1 protein abundance (P = 0.064) and activity (P = 0.036). In STR, HS did not alter protein expression of HSP27, HSP70, or HSP90. Conversely, in STW, MDA-modified proteins remained similar between all groups. Consistent with STR, ZEN decreased GPX1 (P = 0.046) protein abundance in STW. In STW, ZEN decreased protein abundance of HSP27 (P = 0.032) and pHSP27 (P = 0.0068), while HS increased protein expression of HSP70 (P = 0.04) and HSP90 (P = 0.041). These data suggest a muscle fiber type-specific response to HS or ZEN exposure, potentially rendering STR more susceptible to HS- and/or ZEN-induced oxidative stress, however, the combination of HS and ZEN did not augment oxidative stress. Exposure to heat stress and mycotoxin is known to cause alterations in growth and production efficiency. Given the likelihood of simultaneous exposure, we examined how these pathological agents separately and collectively impact outcomes of muscle health in swine. Lay Summary Heat stress (HS) and Zearalenone (ZEN), a toxic feed contaminant, affect growth, production efficiency, and animal welfare, and can cause death. As HS and ZEN independently increase oxidative stress, an imbalance of free radical production and clearance, and the likelihood of ZEN contamination during heat events, we hypothesized concomitant exposure would induce oxidative stress in pig skeletal muscle more than either agent alone. To address this, female pigs were treated with a placebo or low dose of ZEN and exposed to ambient temperature or a mild cyclic HS designed to mimic environmental conditions (hot days, cooler nights) for 7 d. Following these treatments, fast- and slow-twitch muscles were collected for analysis. In slow-twitch muscle, we observed increased markers of oxidative stress in pigs exposed to ZEN primarily driven by HS and ZEN treated pigs. Additionally, ZEN reduced antioxidant abundance and enzymatic activity regardless of the environment. Conversely, HS and/or ZEN did not cause oxidative stress in fast-twitch muscle, although ZEN altered antioxidant abundance. Although a mild HS and ZEN dose was used, oxidative stress markers were altered, suggesting that slow-twitch muscle is susceptible to HS- and ZEN-mediated changes. These data raise the possibility that more severe HS exposures and higher ZEN doses may compromise muscle health.","[Rudolph, Tori E.; Roach, Crystal M.; Baumgard, Lance H.; Ross, Jason W.; Keating, Aileen F.; Selsby, Josh T.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Selsby, JT (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",jselsby@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1,2022,100,8,,,,,,,skac215,10.1093/jas/skac215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/skac215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adjuvants improve vaccine efficacy but often increase reactogenicity. An unconventional behavioral adjuvant is physical exercise at the time of vaccination. Here, in separate experiments, we examined the effect of 90-minute light-to moderate-intensity cycle ergometer or outdoor walk/jog aerobic exercise performed once after immunization on serum antibody response to three different vaccines (2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal influenza, and COVID-19). Exercise took place after influenza vaccination or after the first dose of PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. A mouse model of influenza A immunization was used to examine the effect of exercise on antibody response and the role of IFN alpha as a potential mechanism by treating mice with anti-IFN alpha antibody. The results show that 90 min of exercise consistently increased serum antibody to each vaccine four weeks post-immunization, and IFN alpha may partially contribute to the exercise-related benefit. Exercise did not increase side effects after the COVID-19 vaccination.

In its repetitive mode, it is used for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. It functions on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where generated magnetic fields (H-field) induce electric field (E-field) that stimulates the brain's neurons. With TMS studies, accurate estimation of the induced E-field is usually necessary. However, this requires a lot of processes, including the 3-D head model generation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using the SimNIBS software and finite element analysis to calculate the induced E-field. These processes are time-consuming and computationally expensive. In addition, with each head model's uniqueness, outcomes cannot be generalized across a particular population as the intensity of E-field is subject-specific. In this research, the authors develop deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) models to determine the intensity of the induced E-field directly from the patient's MRI scan and across different coil types. We trained CNN models from anatomically realistic head models and across 16 coil types to predict the induced E-field in the brain and scalp (E-Max brain and scalp), and the volume of stimulation of the brain and scalp (V-half brain and scalp) from T1-weighted MRI scans. Using a deep CNN model, the processing time for estimating the induced E-field is significantly reduced, which is helpful both to clinicians and researchers as the need to create subject-specific anatomical head structures is eliminated. Also, there will be no need for additional stimulation sessions with the different coil types for TMS patients as the deep CNN model can predict the outcome from each coil type. The other advantages of the deep CNN model are that the E-field from the different coil types can be compared simultaneously.","[Afuwape, Oluwaponmile F.; Jiles, David C.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Afuwape, Oluwaponmile F.; Olafasakin, Olumide O.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Afuwape, OF (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Afuwape, OF (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",oafuwape@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,58,2,,,,,,,5800205,10.1109/TMAG.2021.3086761,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2021.3086761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We here report supramolecular protective receptors that outcompete an enzyme in the binding of oligosaccharides. The strong binding inhibits the enzymatic reaction and addition of an even stronger ligand for the receptor releases the substrate. These receptors could be used to control products from the same substrate/enzyme mixture and regulate enzymatic reactions reversibly.,"[Zangiabadi, Milad; Zhao, Yan] Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Chem, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",zhaoy@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 30,2022,58,70,,,,,9770,9773,,10.1039/d2cc03239b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2cc03239b,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Ferhatoglu, C; Miller, BA",,,,"Ferhatoglu, Caner; Miller, Bradley A.",,,Choosing Feature Selection Methods for Spatial Modeling of Soil Fertility Properties at the Field Scale,AGRONOMY-BASEL,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"With the growing availability of environmental covariates, feature selection (FS) is becoming an essential task for applying machine learning (ML) in digital soil mapping (DSM). In this study, the effectiveness of six types of FS methods from four categories (filter, wrapper, embedded, and hybrid) were compared. These FS algorithms chose relevant covariates from an exhaustive set of 1049 environmental covariates for predicting five soil fertility properties in ten fields, in combination with ten different ML algorithms. Resulting model performance was compared by three different metrics (R-2 of 10-fold cross validation (CV), robustness ratio (RR; developed in this study), and independent validation with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (IV-CCC)). FS improved CV, RR, and W-CCC compared to the models built without FS for most fields and soil properties. Wrapper (BorutaShap) and embedded (Lasso-FS, Random forest-FS) methods usually led to the optimal models. The filter-based ANOVA-FS method mostly led to overfit models, especially for fields with smaller sample quantities. Decision-tree based models were usually part of the optimal combination of FS and ML. Considering RR helped identify optimal combinations of FS and ML that can improve the performance of DSM compared to models produced from full covariate stacks.","[Ferhatoglu, Caner; Miller, Bradley A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Miller, BA (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Agron, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",ferhatoglu2@gmail.com; millerba@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,12,8,,,,,,,1786,10.3390/agronomy12081786,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12081786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Shams, A; Day, CM",,,,"Shams, Andalib; Day, Christopher M.",,,Advanced Gap Seeking Logic for Actuated Signal Control Using Vehicle Trajectory Data: Proof of Concept,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,,,,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,,"As detection systems improve, opportunities are emerging for using vehicle position and speed to drive signal control. This study explored how basic actuation processes might be improved by using vehicle position and speed. The position and speed of arriving vehicles were used to calculate their estimated time of arrival. Two variations on vehicle extension logic were developed that extended a green until there was a headway in the arriving traffic above a size that corresponded to a minimum flow rate, at which it was desired to terminate the phase. In the first method, the headway was measured from the point where the leading vehicle passed the stop bar, whereas the second method measured the headway from where the leading vehicle was unlikely to stop at the onset of yellow. This was compared against a control with a conventional stop bar and upstream detectors. A simulation study was carried out for an eight-phase intersection. The results suggest that at higher levels of demand, trajectory-based actuation could yield substantial reductions in delay. The trajectory-based methods were able to terminate green more efficiently, leading to reductions in delay in some cases, and reductions in emissions and fuel consumption, although there was a tradeoff in the number of split failures. These early results show promise for the development and fine-tuning of the methods.","[Shams, Andalib; Day, Christopher M.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Day, CM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",cmday@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/03611981221108147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03611981221108147,,JUL 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we applied machine learning to 16S rRNA sequence and nitrification potential data from an experiment examining interactions between cropping systems and rhizosphere on microbial community assembly and nitrogen cycling processes. Given the high dimensionality of microbiome datasets, we only included nitrifers since only a few taxa are capable of ammonia and nitrite oxidation. We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear algorithms with and without qPCR measures of bacterial and archaea ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene abundance. Our feature selection process facilitated the identification of taxons that are most predictive of nitrification and to compare habitats. We found that Nitrosomonas and Nitrospirae were more frequently identified as important predictors of nitrification in conventional systems, whereas Thaumarchaeota were more important predictors in diversified systems. Our results suggest that model performance was not substantively improved by incorporating additional time-consuming and expensive qPCR data on amoA gene abundance. We also identified several clades of nitrifiers important for nitrification in different cropping systems, though we were unable to detect system- or rhizosphere-specific patterns in OTU-level biomarkers for nitrification. Finally, our results highlight the inherent risk of combining data from disparate habitats with the goal of increasing sample size to avoid overfitting models. This study represents a step toward developing machine learning approaches for microbiome research to identify nitrifier ecotypes that may be important for distinguishing ecotypes with defining roles in different habitats.","[Lee, Conard; Halverson, Larry J.] Iowa State Univ, Interdept Microbiol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Lee, Conard; Halverson, Larry J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Amini, Fatemeh; Hu, Guiping] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Halverson, LJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Interdept Microbiol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Halverson, LJ (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol & Microbiol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",larryh@iastate.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 11,2022,13,,,,,,,,899565,10.3389/fmicb.2022.899565,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.899565,,,,,,,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dual or character group of an abelian group encodes the products of its (linear) irreducible characters. Now, recent developments in combinatorics enable the construction of character groups for finite dihedral and generalized quaternion groups, encoding the products of all the irreducible characters (linear and nonlinear) in purely multiplicative fashion. In particular, just as in the abelian case, each dihedral group may serve as its own character group. Furthermore, certain Adams operations on the characters are shown to correspond to powers in the character group of a dihedral group.","[Stevenson, Justin A.; Smith, Jonathan D.
